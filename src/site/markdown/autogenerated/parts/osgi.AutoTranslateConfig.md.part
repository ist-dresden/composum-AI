## Composum AI Autotranslate Configuration (aem/core)

Configuration of the automatic translation of AEM pages. The OSGI configuration is only used if no Sling CAConfig configuration is found.

| pocUiEnabled                            | Debugging UI                             | boolean | false         | Enable the Autotranslate debugging UI at at /apps/composum-ai/components/autotranslate/list/list.html, normally disabled. Only read from OSGI configuration.                                                                     |

| deniedResourceTypes                     | Denied Resource Types                    | String[]| []            | Regexes for denied Resource Types - if the sling:resourceType matches that, then no attributes or child nodes are touched by the automatic translation.                                                                          |
| allowedAttributeRegexes                 | Allowed Additional Attributes             | String[]| []            | Matches for Attributes that are explicitly allowed to be translated, in addition to standard attributes and heuristically recognized attributes. The heuristics is that the value has to have letters and whitespaces. Syntax: regular expressions that match resource type % attribute name - e.g. myapp/component/html%markup |
| deniedAttributesRegexes                 | Denied Attributes                        | String[]| []            | Attributes that are explicitly denied to be translated. Can be used to override the heuristics / standard attributes. Same syntax as allowed attributes.                                                                           |
| ignoreAssetsExceptContentFragments      | Ignore Assets except Content Fragments    | boolean | true          | If true, assets are ignored for translation, except for content fragments. (Otherwise the translator would translate metadata of images and videos.)                                                                               |
| useHighIntelligenceModel                | Use High Intelligence Model               | boolean | true          | If true, the translator will use the 'high-intelligence model' (see OpenAI config) for translation. Default: true.                                                                                                              |
| includeFullPageInRetranslation          | Include Full Page during Retranslation    | boolean | true          | If true we do not only provide changed texts to the AI during re-translating a page with some changes, but give the entire page to provide better context. That is a bit slower and a bit more expensive, but likely improves the result. |
| includeExistingTranslationsInRetranslation| Include Existing Translations in Retranslation| boolean | true          | If true, when retranslating a page with some changes we provide the existing translations of that page to the AI as well as additional context with examples. That is a bit slower and a bit more expensive, but likely improves the result. |
