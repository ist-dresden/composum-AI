| additionalInstructions                     | Additional Instructions (Deprecated)                | String |               | Additional instructions for the automatic translation. Deprecated, please use 'Rules for additional Instructions' instead - if you do not give a path regex nor a content pattern the instructions will be used everywhere.                        |
| rules                                      | Rules for additional Instructions                    | AutoTranslateRuleConfig[] |               | Rules that give additional instructions for translation if certain words or phrases are present in the page.                                                                                                                                      |

This is an alternative to translation rules if there are many 'Translate X as Y' rules.                                                      |

| includeFullPageInRetranslation            | Include Full Page during Retranslation              | String |               | If true we do not only provide changed texts to the AI during re-translating a page with some changes, but give the entire page to provide better context. That is a bit slower and a bit more expensive, but likely improves the result. This overrides the default from OSGI configuration. |
| includeExistingTranslationsInRetranslation | Include Existing Translations in Retranslation      | String |               | If true, when retranslating a page with some changes we provide the existing translations of that page to the AI as well as additional context with examples. That is a bit slower and a bit more expensive, but likely improves the result. This overrides the default from OSGI configuration. |
| comment                                    | Optional Notes (for your documentation, not used by the application) | String |               | An optional comment about the configuration, for documentation purposes (not used by the translation).                                                                                                                                              |

If not given we use a default: Translate '{0}' as '{1}'.                                      |
