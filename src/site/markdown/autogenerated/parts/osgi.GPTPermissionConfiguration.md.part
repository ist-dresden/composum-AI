## Composum AI Permission Configuration (slingbase)

A configuration for allowed AI services. There can be multiple configurations, and the allowed services are aggregated.
There is a fallback configuration that is used if no other configuration is found, and a factory for multiple configurations which override the fallback configuration if present.
If configured, Sling Context Aware Configuration takes precedence over OSGI configuration.
