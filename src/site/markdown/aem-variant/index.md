# Composum AI for Adobe AEM 6.5 and AEMaaCS

The AEM variant of the [Composum AI](../index.md) supports both AEM 6.5.x and AEM as a Cloud Service. It currently
provides two assistant dialogs with different focus and capabilities:

- the Content Creation Assistant geared to text content generation for direct use in the editor, and
- the Side Panel AI that is geared for analysing and discussing the content of the page or components with the AI, and
  provides a chat like interface.

Both of them offer a library with various prompt examples that can be used as is or
modified into
processing / analysis instructions to process page parts or the whole page text, or external texts into summaries,
introductions, conclusions, rewrite texts, generate suggestions for extending texts, phrases, headlines and so forth.
[Our blog](https://www.composum.com/home/blog/AEM/composumAI-AEM.html) gives a nice quick overview over the
functionality. The [usage documentation](usage.md) is more detailed.
The [installation instructions](installation.md) tell you how to try it out and / or install it in your server. The
Sling package is available freely over the public maven repository. The project
is [open source](https://github.com/ist-dresden/composum-AI) and freely available
under a MIT license.
