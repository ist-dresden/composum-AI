# Application for "differential retranslation"

This is a demonstration of the "differential retranslation" idea for the autmatic translation - see there.

BTW: this mini-app has been completely done by AI, without me writing a single line of code, using the
[AIGenPipeline](https://aigenpipeline.stoerr.net/) tool:
https://github.com/stoerr/AIGenPipeline/tree/develop/examples/differentialReTranslation
I just edited some of the texts.
