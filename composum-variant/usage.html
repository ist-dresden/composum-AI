<p>The advance of generative artificial intelligence (AI) for texts has revolutionized content creation, providing new
opportunities and efficiencies for content management systems (CMS) like Composum Pages. With the emergence of tools
like Composum AI, the power of AI can now be harnessed to support content creation in a way that was not possible
before.</p>
<p>Integrated into the Composum Pages UI, the Composum AI offers assistance for translation, content creation or SEO.
Especially the content creation assistant provides a flexible, yet simple to use power that can support for many tasks
like summarizing, expanding, creating headlines, rewriting text or generating excerpts from text, generating ideas or
even answering questions about a page.</p>
<p>The translation assistant simplifies the process of translating text attributes into different languages. With just a
few clicks, users can access the Translation Dialog within Composum Pages to view and manage translations for various
languages. This feature streamlines the localization process and enhances the user experience for multilingual websites.</p>
<p>The category assistant helps with selecting SEO keywords based on the content of a page. By providing intelligent
suggestions and options for categorizing pages, Composum AI optimizes the SEO potential of each page, improving its
visibility and search engine rankings.</p>
<p>The integration of generative AI into Composum Pages empowers content creators to generate and optimize content more
efficiently. Technical details, specifications and so forth you can find on
the <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/ist-dresden/composum-AI">project's Github repository</a>.</p><section>

<h3><a name="The_translation_assistant"></a>The translation assistant</h3>
<p>The Translation Dialog is a feature in Composum Pages that allows users to easily translate text attributes into
different languages. When editing a page, users may encounter a text field with a translation icon. By clicking on this
icon, the Translation Dialog opens. In the dialog, users can see the texts for all languages that have translations for
the selected attribute. If there is only one source language, the translation request is triggered immediately. Users
can review the translated text, and then choose to accept it (which populates the text field) or cancel the operation.
The dialog includes elements such as a source language selector, a translation display area, accept and cancel buttons,
an error message display, and a loading indicator. The Translation Dialog aims to provide a user-friendly and intuitive
way for users to efficiently manage translations of text attributes in Composum Pages.</p>

<p>The page category assistant displays the current categories along with suggestions of the AI. After the AI suggestions
have been generated, you can select or deselect current categories and suggestions as needed, and then save or abort. If
you feel the need to add further categories or edit them, please select &#x2018;Accept&#x2019; and use the original page properties
dialog for further modification. The page categories can then enhance the SEO potential of the page.</p>

<p>This dialog is probably the most powerful and flexible tool Composum AI offers. The user is able to provide a prompt
that describes what content should be generated and how it should look like, and can select a source from which to
generate. It is possible to select one of a number of predefined prompts and use them as they are or refine them as
needed. A press of the &#x201c;Generate&#x201d; button triggers the content generation. It's possible to edit the generated text or
switch back and forth in a history of generated content for this field, to select the best attempt.</p>
<p>There is also an optional dropdown menu from which text length recommendations can be selected. Additionally, the dialog
is resizable to accommodate large amounts of text, and it displays a loading indicator to indicate when the system is
processing a prompt.</p></section><section>

<h3><a name="Tips_and_Tricks_for_using_the_Content_Creation_Assistant"></a>Tips and Tricks for using the Content Creation Assistant</h3>
<p>To use the make an excerpt from or rewrite of an existing text, you can copy and paste that text into the existing
dialog field and select the text field as base text, or paste it into the content suggestion field and select that as
base text, and then specify in the prompt what you want to be done.</p>
<p>The dialog can be maximized to accomodate more text, and there is also a help window accessible with the &#x201c;?&#x201d; icon.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the generated text, there are several ways to improve it:</p>
<ul>

<li>You can simply retry by pressing the &#x201c;Generate&#x201d; button again.</li>
<li>You can add hints to the prompt how the text should be written. For example &#x201c;Use passive voice and an informative
style.&#x201d; or &#x201c;Make the text engaging and motivating.&#x201d;</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to generate headlines for a component, you could select the component's text as base text and use the &#x201c;10
suggestions for headline&#x201d; prompt. Generally, to get ideas for short texts it can be a good idea to ask the AI to list a
number of suggestions.</p>
<p>Even though that's not the primary use of the assistant, you can (creatively) use it to get answers from the AI about
general questions, or have it use the page content to answer your questions. Just open the assistant on any text field
in the page, use &#x201c;current page text&#x201d; as base text or even &#x201c;no text&#x201d; and ask away. Of course you might want to press &quot;
Cancel&quot; after such use.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Sidebar_AI"></a>The Sidebar AI</h2>
<p>The Sidebar AI can serve as a complementary addition to the content creation assistant. It's primary focus is not so
much content creation, but to use the AI to generate reports about the text content of the page or individual components
that can help you improve it, or provide you with the possibility to ask questions about it's responses in a chat
format.</p>
<p>There is also a number of predefined prompts you could select, but you are invited to modify them or write your own

just retry), and it is possible to use a chat to ask further questions about the response and have the AI elaborate. At
the bottom of reach response appears a new prompt input field, where it's possible to continue in a conversation. There
is, however, a limit in the length of conversations, so it's better to start fresh when the topic is changed. You can
always go back using the history, and even continue the old conversation, which will be saved as a new history entry.</p></section></section><section>
