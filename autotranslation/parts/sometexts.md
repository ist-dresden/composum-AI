Intro:

Hi, I'm Hans-Peter!

Today I'd like to show you our newest feature of our Composum AI: automatic site translation for AEM sites. This uses those fabulous OpenAI large language models for some features you don't have with conventional machine translation. The large language model can look at the whole text of the page at one go and thus adapt the translation of the individual texts to the text flow. And you can give it instructions to modify the translation, influencing the tone and style and give it some hints how to translate special terms.

And there is more. The AEM language copy mechanism is wonderful to translate a site the first time. But if you want to update the pages, this is a bit cumbersome. Instead of this, we are integrating the automatic translation into the rollout of AEM life copies. So you just change a page, hit rollout, and only moments later it will appear in all the languages you had the site translated to. It's easy to set up, and in addition to the translation, you can use all the other features of the open-source Composum AI, too.

But have a look at how this works for yourself!

So that's it for today. How about just trying it out? Remember, Composum AI is free and open source. You can just grab a copy and install it on your local system or on a test system and see how it performs on your site. Have fun with it, and please tell us how it goes and contact me in case of any questions. Perhaps it's just the thing that will save you a lot of time in managing your site!
