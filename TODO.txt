## Perhaps refactor the paths

/libs/composum/pages/options/ai -> /apps/composum/ai ? That does fit the other pages extensions -> keep options/ai
/apps/composum-ai -> /apps/composum/ai

/apps/composum-ai-packages/content/install -> /apps/composum/ai/install
/apps/composum-ai-packages/application/install -> /apps/composum/ai/install

Reason was that I'd like to place the sidebar prompt json and the content creation prompt json at the same place, if need
be at /apps / /libs , but that'd mean I'd have to create a new /apps/composum/ai/ just for that.
