Generated with ... in conf pages
http://localhost:4502/editor.html/content/dam/wknd/en/magazine/arctic-surfing/aloha-spirits-in-northern-norway doesnt add page text or component text!!!

- default icon for ai.composum site
!!! Dictation in Chat repeat in history bar.
!! Empty prompt text
!! http://localhost:5502/editor.html/content/xxx/com/en/about-us/going-forward.html "Explore the world..." RTE
PDF and markdown as possible datatypes for the content creation dialog
https://www.stoerr.net/outgoing/adaptto-speedwalking.txt als URL - Format geht verloren!!!!

The content creation dialog should know about the current text even if the page is the source!!!!

Why are the teasers in

not included into the excerpt.

? Add history in content creation dialog, current component, last text, ...

----------------

- Marker on page whenever a translation is in progress
- Display errors in workflows?
- Better document autotranslation configuration at https://ai.composum.com/aem-variant/automaticTranslation.html - see https://ai.composum.com/autogenerated/slingcaconfigurations.html#slingca.AutoTranslateCaConfig

Offer parent container as content creation dialog source
Document using Claude, Gemini, https://octo.ai/product/text-generation/ , local
Problems in Composum version:
- when using assistant on creation dialog, and then opening it again, it should have the same settings as when creating (?)
- last 20 prompts not yet implemented

perhaps: chat could be high intelligence powered

## Perhaps refactor the paths

/libs/composum/pages/options/ai -> /apps/composum/ai ? That does fit the other pages extensions -> keep options/ai
/apps/composum-ai -> /apps/composum/ai

/apps/composum-ai-packages/content/install -> /apps/composum/ai/install
/apps/composum-ai-packages/application/install -> /apps/composum/ai/install

Reason was that I'd like to place the sidebar prompt json and the content creation prompt json at the same place, if need
be at /apps / /libs , but that'd mean I'd have to create a new /apps/composum/ai/ just for that.


### TODO

README.md -> move Composum into the background.
