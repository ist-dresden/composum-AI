# Documentation Index

This file serves as an index for all .md files in the project. It provides a brief description of what information can be found in each file.

Generated with ChatGPT using [Co-Developer GPT engine](https://codevelopergptengine.stoerr.net/) and
prompt:
Update a file .docindex.md that contains an index of all .md files in the project, as a helper for locating a
    documentation. For each .md file it should have an entry that tells what information is found there. (Not a summary -
    the file should help to find the right .md file). Index only markdown files which are named with extension .md, nothing
    else.
    Go step by step: first check what entries docindex.md already has, then list what .md files are there, read a .md file
    for which there is no entry yet and create it in docindex.md, until all files are indexed.
    Continue without asking until all is done.
