# Configuration of Composum AI

Status: partially specified and implemented - only the API key

## Basic idea

We need a way to configure the application for several points:

- the API key for OpenAI
- permission configuraiton for which users / groups / pages / components / templates / views which AI dialog is enabled
- the rate limiting
- the prompt library

There should be a basic configuration in the OSGI (or a default contained in the application itself, if applicable),
but all these configurations can be site-specific, or even user-specific. So it's more appropriate to have a
configuration in the JCR repository that is inherited from parent pages and takes precedence over OSGI configuration
if present.

As a first step, we will only implement the API key configuration and permission configuration.

## Basic implementation decisions

We will use Sling Context Aware Configuration for that. There will be @interface configuration classes for that using
@Configuration . There will be separate configuration classes for the API key, the rate limiting and the prompt library.

## Not in scope

As a first step, we currently will not implement configuring the rate limiting and the prompt library. The aim of the
design in this document is, however, to make it easy to add these later, without changing the basic design.
We currently do not implement user specific configuration, version control, environment-based configuration,
configuration auditing, configuration validation.

## Implementation details

### OpenAI key configuration

package com.composum.ai.backend.slingbase.model;

import org.apache.sling.caconfig.annotation.Configuration;
import org.apache.sling.caconfig.annotation.Property;

@Configuration(label = "Composum AI OpenAI Configuration", description = "Configurations for the OpenAI backend for
Composum AI")
// is also added to Sling-ContextAware-Configuration-Classes bnd header in pom.xml
public @interface OpenAIConfig {

    @Property(label = "OpenAI API Key", description = "OpenAI API Key from https://platform.openai.com/. If not given, this falls back to the OSGI configuration, the environment Variable OPENAI_API_KEY, and the system property openai.api.key .")
    String openAiApiKey();

}

We have a fallback hierarchy for the OpenAI API key:

- Sling Context Aware Configuration
- OSGI configuration at "Composum AI OpenAI Configuration" - this is configured by default for AEMaaCS
  as $[secret:OPENAI_API_KEY] to retrieve a value configurable in the cloud manager
- Environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY

For the sling context aware configuration, we have a configuration
com.composum.ai.backend.slingbase.model.OpenAIConfig with the property openAiApiKey . Thus, set up configuration of
the API key in the JCR repository has the following possibilities:

- to enable it globally (even if you do not normally use Sling Context Aware Configuration), you could set up a
  configuration node at
  /conf/global/sling:configs/com.composum.ai.backend.slingbase.model.OpenAIConfig
  with the property openAiApiKey set to the OpenAI API key. Caution: this requires read permissions for the users.
- to enable it for a site or page tree that already has a sling:configRef set up (searchable with query
  /content//*[@sling:configRef]) you could set up a configuration node
  com.composum.ai.backend.slingbase.model.OpenAIConfig in
  the corresponding /conf/.../sling:configs node.
- otherwise you'd have to set up Sling Context Aware Configuration for the page tree in question.

### Permission configuration

We use a fallback hierarchy for the permission configuration:

- Sling Context Aware Configuration
- an OSGI configuration factory at "Composum AI Permission Configuration"
- a single OSGI configuration at "Composum AI Permission Configuration" that is the default configuration when
  nothing else is found

For the sling context aware configuration, we have a configuration list at
`com.composum.ai.backend.slingbase.model.GPTPermissionConfiguration` .
with the following properties:

| Configuration Key    | Description                                                                                                                                                                    | Default Value                            |

| services             | List of services to which this configuration applies. Possible values are: "categorize", "create", "sidepanel", "translate" . For AEM only create and sidepanel are supported. | categorize, create, sidepanel, translate |
| allowedUsers         | Regular expressions for allowed users or user groups. If not present, no user is allowed from this configuration.                                                              | .*                                       |
| deniedUsers          | Regular expressions for denied users or user groups. Takes precedence over allowed users.                                                                                      |                                          |

| deniedPaths          | Regular expressions for denied content paths. Takes precedence over allowed paths.                                                                                             | /content/dam/.*                          |
| allowedViews         | Regular expressions for allowed views - that is, for URLs like /editor.html/.* . If not present, no views are allowed. Use .* to allow all views.                              | .*                                       |

| allowedComponents    | Regular expressions for allowed resource types of components. If not present, no components are allowed.                                                                       | .*                                       |
| deniedComponents     | Regular expressions for denied resource types of components. Takes precedence over allowed components.                                                                         |                                          |
| allowedPageTemplates | Regular expressions for allowed page templates. If not present, all page templates are allowed.                                                                                | .*                                       |
| deniedPageTemplates  | Regular expressions for denied page templates. Takes precedence over allowed page templates.                                                                                   |                                          |

It is possible to create several list entries allowing a subset of the services (dialogs) for a subset of users,
sites, components and so forth. Permissions are additive.
