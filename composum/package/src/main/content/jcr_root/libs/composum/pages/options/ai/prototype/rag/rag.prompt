Generate a HTML page that contains a form calling the RAGServlet . You can use bootstrap and jquery.
Include a path and limit field and query textarea and a submit button that triggers the actual call to the RAGServlet.
The page is deployed on the same host as the servlet.
Parse the result list and display the paths as links, leave out a /jcr:content at the end of the path but add a .html
The text of the link is the path, the title is additional text without link.
The description should be a tooltip but the title displayed in clear text.
