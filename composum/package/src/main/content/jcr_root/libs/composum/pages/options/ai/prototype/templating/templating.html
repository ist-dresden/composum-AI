<!-- AIGenPromptStart(foobar)

Generate a HTML page "Create a page from a template with AI" that contains a form calling the AITemplatingServlet appropriately.

You can use bootstrap and jquery. Make it pleasantly colorful with pastel colors, blueish.
Include a three sentence description what the application does, and a one sentence description on each field.
The page is deployed on the same host as the servlet.

It should include a form that contains the parameters for the AITemplatingServlet. Only one additionalUrls parameter is needed.
There should be buttons for each of the methods (enum Method) defined in the servlet.

Display the result of the execution in a div below the form.
Disable the buttons while the request is running.

On each submit the values of the fields should be stored in localStorage at key composum-ai-prototype-templating ,
and on first loading of the page the last values should be restored from there.
